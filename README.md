## 🔗 Public API Used

We use the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for fetching product listings:
- `https://fakestoreapi.com/products` - Get all products
- `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{id}` - Get product details
- `https://fakestoreapi.com/cart/{id}` cart by id
- `https://fakestoreapi.com/cart/` - Get cart details

This API is free and perfect for demo/testing purposes.
